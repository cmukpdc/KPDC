			<h2>Official Subunits</h2>
			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Official subunits are dances that anybody can join at the beginning of the semester and are performed at the KPDC Showcase. There is a matching process to ensure fair assignments and to prevent overflow.</p>
			<div class="schedule">
				<h3>Schedule</h3>
			</div>
			<h3>Announcements</h3>
			<p>No announcements at this time!</p>
			<h3>Subunit Matching Process</h3>
			<h4>When/Where?</h4>
			<p>The week after CMU&#39;s Activites Fair (TBD). Attend open classes for your favorite dances during the week. The times and places listed will be the subunit&#39;s normal practices throughout the semester.</p>
			<h4>How to Participate</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Rank your subunits [Form](TBD)</p></li>
				<li><p>Attend a subunit open class to learn a portion of the choreo. The subunit leader will then record everyone&#39;s progress at the end to help us match you with a subunit.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Results</h4>
			<p>After the first week, we will review the rankings and videos and match you to a subunit!</p>
			<h4>What if I can&#39;t make a subunit time?</h4>
			<p>That&#39;s okay! As long as you attend at least one subunit open class, we can still try to match you according to your rankings.</p>

		<section id="sideprojects">
			<h2>Side Projects</h2>
			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>While official subunits are formed through KPDC, projects allow members to form their own dance groups however they would like to. Projects will have opportunities to perform in the showcase and other events representing the club.</p>
			<h3>Project Form</h3>
			<p>If you...</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Formed a project group</p></li>
				<li><p>Want to begin a project group</p></li>
				<li><p>Want to find more members to join your project group</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Fill out the project form!</p>
			<p>[Form link + Current projects link](TBD)</p>
			<h3>Project Reservations (only available before the start of a semester)</h3>
			<h4>About</h4>
			<p>Because there are often comebacks when we are on summer or winter break, it&#39;s hard to distribute dances choices. While we prioritize our official subunits, we also want to give members the opportunity to call &ldquo;dibs&rdquo; on a dance <strong>before</strong> subunits are decided for the semester. Of course, there are some rules to reserving projects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Group members can only be in one reserved dance</p></li>
				<li><p>Dance must already be released</p></li>
				<li><p>Group members must be confirmed by the time the form closes</p></li>
				<li><p>Leader or group member must hold at least one open class for this dance</p></li>
				<li><p>Dance must be performed at KPDC Showcase (TBD)</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Breaking any of these rules will result in banning all group members from reserving dances for following semesters. While we encourage projects, we place higher priority on our subunits, thus we will be enforcing these rules.</p>
			<h4>FAQ</h4>
			<h5>Why exactly are you doing this?</h5>
			<p>Subunits are great because they allow you to mingle, grow, and dance with other dancers in a consistent time and place. Everyone is guaranteed a subunit spot as well as a guaranteed chance to perform in the KPDC showcase. Subunits are formed for the purpose of <strong>giving everyone an opportunity to dance.</strong> However, projects allow members who feel stifled by the subunit process to perform their desired dance.</p>
			<h5>What if I don&#39;t have group members for my project?</h5>
			<p>You have the choice of either handpicking your members or submitting the reservation form with the purpose of looking for members to join you. The results will be public so people can contact you. If, however, by the form deadline you have not confirmed your group, the project will be dropped.</p>
			<h5>Can I still sign up for subunits/other projects?</h5>
			<p>Yes! You are only restricted to one <strong>reserved group</strong> project. You are still free to try for subunits and form other projects after the reservation time frame is over.</p>
			<h4>Process</h4>
			<p>A form to sign up will be posted in the KPDC  on __________(TBD). First come first serve. The results will be made public but will not be confirmed until after the form deadline.</p>

			<h2>Cover Contests</h2>
