					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>While official subunits are formed through KPDC, projects allow members to form their own dance groups however they would like to, but are not guaranteed the same support subunits receive. </p>

                    <p><strong>Join</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1632044576816259/">this Facebook group</a> to view open, ongoing, and closed projects! All project creation, recruitment, and related news will occur in this group.</p>

					<p>If you have any other questions regarding Projects contact Jessica Li on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jessica.notsaying?ref=br_rs">Facebook</a> or email her at <a href="mailto:jjli2@andrew.cmu.edu">jjli2@andrew.cmu.edu</a>!</p>

					<h2>Project Rules</h2>
					
					<p>1. Claiming a project is first come, first serve. </p>
					<p> 2. When making a post about a project, you need to include the following information:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Who is/are the project leader(s)?</p> </li>

							<li> <p>Is the project open to all or by audition? </p></li>

							<li><p>How many spots are still available? </p></li>

							<li><p>Are you trying to perform for showcase, perform in general, or just for a video? </p></li>

							<li><p>Who should be contacted, and how, if interested?</p> </li>

							<li> <p>A link to the dance</p></li>
						</ul>

					<p>3. All posts in this group will be reviewed before being posted in order to ensure there are no duplicates in projects.</p>
					
					<p>4. Mark the post as [OPEN] while spots are still available. Once a dance is full, please edit posts as [CLOSED] to indicate that it is full.</p>

					<h3>NEW</h3>

					<p>5. You are allowed to reserve a project if it is currently reserved. You will be put on a waitlist until the current project is dropped.

					<p>6. There is no longer a 2 week rule, but projects are expected to start practicing within a reasonable time period once they are reserved.

					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					<h3>Why exactly are you doing this?</h3>
					<p>Subunits are great because they allow you to mingle, grow, and dance with other dancers in a consistent time and place. Everyone is guaranteed a subunit spot as well as a guaranteed chance to perform in the KPDC showcase--but not guaranteed to perform a specific dance. Subunits are formed for the purpose of <strong>giving everyone an opportunity to dance.</strong> However, projects allow the very few members who feel stifled by the subunit process to perform their desired dance, but are not guaranteed full club support. <strong>If you are not completely confident about reserving a project, DO NOT reserve one.</strong></p>

					<h3>What if I don&#39;t have group members for my project?</h3>
					<p>You have the choice of either handpicking your members or looking for interested members in the Facebook group.</p>

					<h3>Can I still sign up for subunits/other projects?</h3>
					<p>Yes! You are free to try for subunits and other projects, keeping within the limit of 4 ongoing dances.</p>

					<h3>What if multiple people reserve the same project at the same time?</h3>
					<p>The first come, first serve rule always holds, but the two people can choose to merge projects. Project conflicts will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. You are still allowed to reserve a project and be put on waitlist even if it is already reserved. A post will be made in the Facebook group once a project is dropped and available for reservation again. 

					<h3>What if an emergency occurs and I end up breaking the rules?</h3>
					<p>We will make exceptions for extreme cases. Contact our Communications Chair if this happens.</p>
