					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>While official subunits are formed through KPDC, projects allow members to form their own dance groups however they would like to, but are not guaranteed the same support subunits receive. </p>

                    <p>Join <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1632044576816259/">this Facebook group</a> to view open, ongoing, and closed projects!</p>

                    <h3>New this Semester!</h3>
                    <p> If you are interested in being in or leading a project, be sure to join <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1632044576816259/">OUR NEW KPDC PROJECTS FACEBOOK GROUP</a> where you can get updated on what projects are currently happening and make posts to recruit people. Please make sure that all posts relating to project creation occur in this new group. </p>

					<h2>Project Rules</h2>
					
					<p>1. Claiming a project is first come, first serve. </p>
					<p> 2. When making a post about a project, you need to include the following information:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Who is/are the project leader(s)?</p> </li>

							<li> <p>Is the project open to all or by audition? </p></li>

							<li><p>How many spots are still available? </p></li>

							<li><p>Are you trying to perform for showcase, perform in general, or just for a video? </p></li>

							<li><p>Who should be contacted, and how, if interested?</p> </li>

							<li> <p>A link to the dance </p></li>
						</ul>

					<p>3. All posts in this group will be reviewed before being posted in order to ensure there are no duplicates in projects.</p>

					<p>4. If you are doing a project and have all your members, you do not need to post in the group. However, please contact Sheela Hanagal to make sure we know that the project is happening and don't approve anyone else for the same dance. </p>
					
					<p>5. Once a dance is full, please edit posts to indicate that it is full.</p>

					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					<h3>Why exactly are you doing this?</h3>
					<p>Subunits are great because they allow you to mingle, grow, and dance with other dancers in a consistent time and place. Everyone is guaranteed a subunit spot as well as a guaranteed chance to perform in the KPDC showcase--but not guaranteed to perform a specific dance. Subunits are formed for the purpose of <strong>giving everyone an opportunity to dance.</strong> However, projects allow the very few members who feel stifled by the subunit process to perform their desired dance, but are not guaranteed full club support. <strong>If you are not completely confident about reserving a project, DO NOT reserve one.</strong></p>

					<h3>What if I don&#39;t have group members for my project?</h3>
					<p>You have the choice of either handpicking your members or submitting the reservation form with the purpose of looking for members to join you. The results will be public so people can contact you. If, however, by the form deadline you have not confirmed your group, the project will be dropped.</p>

					<h3>Can I still sign up for subunits/other projects?</h3>
					<p>Yes! You are only restricted to one <strong>reserved group</strong> project. You are still free to try for subunits and form other projects after the reservation time frame is over.</p>
					<h3>What if an emergency occurs and I end up breaking the rules?</h3>
					<p>We will make exceptions for extreme cases. Contact our Communications Chair if this happens.</p>
