					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>While official subunits are formed through KPDC, projects allow members to form their own dance groups however they would like to, but are not guaranteed the same support subunits receive. </p>

                    <p><strong>Join</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1632044576816259/">this Facebook group</a> to view open, ongoing, and closed projects! All project creation, recruitment, and related news will occur in this group.</p>

					<p>If you have any other questions regarding Projects contact Anne He on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anne.9.he">Facebook</a> or email her at <a href="mailto:afhe@andrew.cmu.edu">afhe@andrew.cmu.edu</a>!</p>

					<h2>Project Rules</h2>
					
					<p>1. Anybody can claim any song as a project, including projects and subunits that have been done before and duplicates. </p>
					<p> 2. When making a post about a project, you need to include the following information:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Who is/are the project leader(s)?</p> </li>

							<li> <p>Is the project open to all or by audition? </p></li>

							<li><p>How many spots are still available? </p></li>

							<li><p>Are you trying to perform for showcase, perform in general, or just for a video? </p></li>

							<li><p>Who should be contacted, and how, if interested?</p> </li>

							<li> <p>A link to the dance</p></li>
						</ul>

					<p>3. All posts in this group will be reviewed before being posted.</p>
					
					<p>4. Mark the post as [OPEN] while spots are still available. Once a dance is full, please edit posts as [CLOSED] to indicate that it is full.</p>

					<p>5. Subunits get first priority for a song. 

					<p>6. Projects must contact Lexin Yuan about filming at least 1 week before the date they plan to film.

					<p>7. Projects are not eligible for showcase if they have been performed at showcase within the past 4 years.

					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					<h3>Why exactly are you doing this?</h3>
					<p>Subunits are great because they allow you to mingle, grow, and dance with other dancers in a consistent time and place. Everyone is guaranteed a subunit spot as well as a guaranteed chance to perform in the KPDC showcase. Subunits are formed for the purpose of <strong>giving everyone an opportunity to dance.</strong> However, projects allow members who feel stifled by the subunit process to perform their desired dance, but are not guaranteed full club support or a spot in showcase.</p>

					<h3>What if I don&#39;t have group members for my project?</h3>
					<p>You have the choice of either handpicking your members or looking for interested members in the Facebook group.</p>

					<h3>Can I still sign up for subunits/other projects?</h3>
					<p>Yes! You are free to try for subunits and other projects.</p>

					<h3>What if multiple people reserve the same project at the same time?</h3>
					<p>The first come, first serve rule has been removed, so this is perfectly fine. Both projects can film, but only one can perform at showcase</p>
