					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Official subunits are dances that anybody can join at the beginning of the semester and are performed at the KPDC Showcase. There is a matching process to ensure fair assignments and to prevent overflow.</p>

					<h3>New this Semester!</h3>
					<p>This semester there will be 2 types of official subunits - Open and Audition.</p>

					<h3>Open Subunits</h3>
					<p>Open subunits are first-come first-serve, meaning the sooner you fill out the subunit ranking form the more likely you will get into one of the open subunits. Open Subunits are a great way to be a part of dance if it&#39;s your first time. </p>

					<h3>Audition Subunits</h3>
					<p>Audition subunits are more skills-based than open subunits so you will need to attend an audition for each audition subunit you are interested in.</p>

					<h3>DS Subunit</h3>
					<p>This subunit performs at both the KPDC and the DS showcases. You will need to attend the DS subunit audition for acceptance into this subunit. </p>


					<p><strong>Subunit matching</strong> is starting Monday, January 22! </p>

					<h2>Subunit Matching Process</h2>

					<h3>When/Where?</h3>
					<p>Subunit open classes will be starting Monday, Janurary 22nd. Refer to the schedule above for specific time/date and location for each subunit open class. Attend open classes for your favorite dances during the week. The times and places listed will be the subunit&#39;s normal practices throughout the semester. </p>


				<!--	<h3>What if the practice time conflicts with a prior commitment (i.e. class, club meeting, research)?</h3>-->

					<h3>How do I Join an Open Subunit? </h3>

					<p>1. Show up to any open subunit class (does not have to be your top choice)</p>

					<p>2. Fill out the subunit ranking form (by Jan. 29th 11:59pm) which will be released January 27th 11:59pm. </p>

					<p>3. Acceptances into open subunits are determined by FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVE signup via the form. Other members will be waitlisted. Note that filling out the form early does not decide which subunit you will be in but it does guarantee you a spot in an open subunit. The sooner you fill out the form the more likely it is that you will get into your prefereed subunit. </p>
					<p> <strong>Note: </strong> You can only be in a MAXIMUM OF ONE open subunit.</p>

					<p>2. Fill out the subunit ranking form (by Jan. 29th 11:59pm) which will be released January 27th 11:59pm.</p>
