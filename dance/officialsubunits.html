					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Official subunits are dances that anybody can join at the beginning of the semester and are performed at the KPDC Showcase. There is a matching process to ensure fair assignments and to prevent overflow.</p>

					<h2>Announcements</h2>

					<h2>Subunit Matching Process</h2>
					<h3>When/Where?</h3>
					<p>The week after CMU&#39;s Activites Fair (Sept. 6). Attend open classes for your favorite dances during the week. The times and places listed will be the subunit&#39;s normal practices throughout the semester.</p>
					<h3>How to Participate</h3>
					<p>Rank your subunits! The form for Fall 2017 is now officially released:</p>

					<p />
					<p>Attend a subunit open class to learn a portion of the choreo. The subunit leader will then record everyone&#39;s progress at the end to help us match you with a subunit.</p>
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p>After the first week, we will review the rankings and videos and match you to a subunit!</p>
					<h3>What if I can&#39;t make a subunit time that week?</h3>
					<p>That&#39;s okay! As long as you attend at least one subunit open class, we can still try to match you according to your rankings. You&#39;ll have to be able to make that time for the rest of the semester though.</p>
