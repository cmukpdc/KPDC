			<h1>Official Subunits</h1>

					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Official subunits are dances that anybody can join at the beginning of the semester and are performed at the KPDC Showcase. There is a matching process to ensure fair assignments and to prevent overflow. Note you must be AVAILABLE on November 30th, Friday, for the KPDC Showcase in order to be part of an official subunit. </p>

					<h3>Open Subunits</h3>
					<p>Open subunits are first-come first-serve, meaning the sooner you fill out the subunit ranking form the more likely you will get into one of the open subunits. Open Subunits are a great way to be a part of dance if it&#39;s your first time. </p>

					<h2>Subunit Matching Process</h2>

					<h3>When/Where?</h3>
					<p>Subunit open classes will be starting Monday, Janurary 22nd. Refer to the schedule above for specific time/date and location for each subunit open class. Attend open classes for your favorite dances during the week. The times and places listed will be the subunit&#39;s normal practices throughout the semester. </p>


				<!--	<h3>What if the practice time conflicts with a prior commitment (i.e. class, club meeting, research)?</h3>-->

					<h3>How do I Join an Open Subunit? </h3>

					<p>1. Show up to any open subunit class or audition during subunit matching week (does not have to be your top choice)</p>

					<p>2. Fill out the subunit ranking form by 12:00 PM Sunday, September 16 which will be released on Saturday, September 15 at 11:59pm. </p>

					<p>3. Acceptances into open subunits are determined by FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVE signup via the form. Other members will be waitlisted. Note that filling out the form early does not decide which subunit you will be in but it does guarantee you a spot in an open subunit. The sooner you fill out the form the more likely it is that you will get into your preferred subunit. Please try to rank as many dances as possible so that you still get a subunit even if it isn't your top choice.</p>
					<p> <strong>NOTE: </strong> You can only be in a MAXIMUM OF ONE open subunit.</p>

					
					<h3>How do I Join an Audition Subunit? </h3>
					<p>1. Show up to the audition for the audition subunit you are interested in.</p>
					<p>2. Fill out the subunit ranking form by 12:00 PM Sunday, September 16 which will be released on Saturday, September 15 11:59pm.</p>
					<p>3. Acceptances into Audition subunits are determined by skills at the audition.</p>
					
					<h3>How do I Join the DS Subunit? </h3>
					<p>1. Show up to the DS subunit audition which will be happening on Sunday, September 16 in UC Keeler Studio.</p>
					<p>2. Acceptances into DS subunits are determined by skills at the audition.</p>
					<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> KPDC DS Subunit does not require members to fill out the subunit ranking form. </p>
					
					<h3>How many dances can I be in?</h3>
					<p>You are limited to ONE Open Subunit. NEW THIS SEMESTER, we are also limiting people to 4 ongoing KPDC dances (subunits and projects combined). Please keep this in mind when applying for subunits.</p>

					<h3>When do Results come out?</h3>
					<p>On Sunday September 16th (probably in the evening)</p>
