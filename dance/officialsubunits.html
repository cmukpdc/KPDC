					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Official subunits are dances that anybody can join at the beginning of the semester and are performed at the KPDC Showcase. There is a matching process to ensure fair assignments and to prevent overflow.</p>

					<h3>New this Semester!</h3>
					<p>This semester there will be 2 types of official subunits - Open and Audition.</p>

					<h3>Open Subunits</h3>
					<p>Open subunits are first-come first-serve, meaning the sooner you fill out the subunit ranking form the more likely you will get into one of the open subunits. Open Subunits are a great way to be a part of dance if it's your first time. </p>

					<h3>Audition Subunits</h3>
					<p>Audition subunits are more skills-based than open subunits so you will need to attend an audition for each audition subunit you are interested in.</p>

					<h3>DS Subunit</h3>
					<p>This subunit performs at both the KPDC and the DS showcases. You will need to attend the DS subunit audition for acceptance into this subunit. </p>


					<p><strong>Subunit matching</strong> is starting the 2nd week of school! The schedule for the subunit open classes will be available soon. </p>
