				<h2>Open Class</h2>
				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Open classes are one-hour sessions every week where anyone is welcome to learn K-Pop choreo (choreo lessons) or other dance techniques (workshops).</p>
				<div class="schedule">
					<h3>Schedule</h3>
					<p>The schedule for our Open Classes will be released starting Fall 2017 with new updates every two weeks.</p>

				<h2>Official Subunits</h2>
				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Official subunits are dances that anybody can join at the beginning of the semester and are performed at the KPDC Showcase. There is a matching process to ensure fair assignments and to prevent overflow.</p>
				<h3>Announcements</h3>
				<p>No announcements at this time!</p>
				<div class="schedule">
					<h3>Schedule</h3>
					<p>The schedule for the Official Subunits will be released in Fall 2017.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Subunit Matching Process</h3>
				<div class="indent">
					<h4 class="topspace">When/Where?</h4>
					<p>The week after CMU&#39;s Activites Fair (TBD). Attend open classes for your favorite dances during the week. The times and places listed will be the subunit&#39;s normal practices throughout the semester.</p>
					<h4>How to Participate</h4>
					<p>Rank your subunits! The form will be released Fall 2017.</p>
					<p>Attend a subunit open class to learn a portion of the choreo. The subunit leader will then record everyone&#39;s progress at the end to help us match you with a subunit.</p>
					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p>After the first week, we will review the rankings and videos and match you to a subunit!</p>
					<h4>What if I can&#39;t make a subunit time that week?</h4>
					<p>That&#39;s okay! As long as you attend at least one subunit open class, we can still try to match you according to your rankings. You&#39;ll have to be able to make that time for the rest of the semester though.</p>

			<section id="sideprojects">
				<h2>Side Projects</h2>
				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>While official subunits are formed through KPDC, projects allow members to form their own dance groups however they would like to, but are not guaranteed the same support subunits receive. Projects will have opportunities to perform in the showcase and other events representing the club.</p>
				<p>If you...</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Formed a project group</p></li>
					<li><p>Want to begin a project group</p></li>
					<li><p>Want to find more members to join your project group</p></li>
				</ul>
				<p><a href="#">Fill out the project form! The form will be released Fall 2017.</a></p>
				<h3>Project Reservations (only available before the start of a semester)</h3>
				<div class="indent">
					<h4 class="topspace">About</h4>
					<p>Because there are often comebacks when we are on summer or winter break, it&#39;s hard to distribute dances choices. While we prioritize our official subunits, we also want to give members the opportunity to call &ldquo;dibs&rdquo; on a dance <strong>before</strong> subunits are decided for the semester. Of course, there are some rules to reserving projects:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Group members can only be in one reserved dance</p></li>
						<li><p>Dance must already be released</p></li>
						<li><p>Group members must be confirmed by the time the form closes</p></li>
						<li><p>Leader or group member must hold at least one open class for this dance</p></li>
						<li><p>Dance must be performed at KPDC Showcase, December 1st, 2017 at 8:00pm.</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Breaking any of these rules will result in banning all group members from reserving dances for following semesters. While we encourage projects, we place higher priority on our subunits, thus we will be enforcing these rules.</p>
					<h4>Process</h4>
					<p>A form to sign up will be posted on July 19, at 10:00pm. First come first serve. The results will be made public but will not be confirmed until after the form deadline.</p>
					<h4>FAQ</h4>
					<h5>Why exactly are you doing this?</h5>
					<p>Subunits are great because they allow you to mingle, grow, and dance with other dancers in a consistent time and place. Everyone is guaranteed a subunit spot as well as a guaranteed chance to perform in the KPDC showcase--but not guaranteed to perform a specific dance. Subunits are formed for the purpose of <strong>giving everyone an opportunity to dance.</strong> However, projects allow members who feel stifled by the subunit process to perform their desired dance, but are not guaranteed full club support. <strong>If you are not completely confident about reserving a project, DO NOT reserve one.</strong></p>
					<h5>What if I don&#39;t have group members for my project?</h5>
					<p>You have the choice of either handpicking your members or submitting the reservation form with the purpose of looking for members to join you. The results will be public so people can contact you. If, however, by the form deadline you have not confirmed your group, the project will be dropped.</p>
					<h5>Can I still sign up for subunits/other projects?</h5>
					<p>Yes! You are only restricted to one <strong>reserved group</strong> project. You are still free to try for subunits and form other projects after the reservation time frame is over.</p>
					<h5>What if an emergency occurs and I end up breaking the rules?</h5>
					<p>We will make exceptions for extreme cases. Contact our secretary if this happens.</p>

			<section id="covercontests">
				<h2>Cover Contests</h2>
				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Cover contest dances are formed for 1theK Dance Cover Contests. These contests occur a few times within the semester and end within around a week and a half. Cover contest members will have to practice almost every day in order to film and edit a video before the deadline. Cover contests are a great opportunity to be exposed to intensive dancing! You can see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzk06MgibYs1c7H38FBzykUaHJoLcMdFN">YouTube playlist here.</a></p>
				<h3>Audition Process</h3>
				<p>Attend the audition for a cover contest dance to learn a portion of the choreo. The dance directors and dance cover leader will then record everyone&#39;s progress at the end to determine audition results.</p>
