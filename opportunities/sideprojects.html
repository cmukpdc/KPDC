					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>While official subunits are formed through KPDC, projects allow members to form their own dance groups however they would like to, but are not guaranteed the same support subunits receive. Projects will have opportunities to perform in the showcase and other events representing the club.</p>
					<p>If you...</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Formed a project group</p></li>
						<li><p>Want to begin a project group</p></li>
						<li><p>Want to find more members to join your project group</p></li>

					<h2>Project Reservations<br>(only available before the start of a semester)</h2>
					<p>Because there are often comebacks when we are on summer or winter break, it&#39;s hard to distribute dances choices. While we prioritize our official subunits, we also want to give members the opportunity to call &ldquo;dibs&rdquo; on a dance <strong>before</strong> subunits are decided for the semester. Of course, there are some rules to reserving projects:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Group members can only be in one reserved dance</p></li>
						<li><p>Dance must already be released</p></li>
						<li><p>Group members must be confirmed by the time the form closes</p></li>
						<li><p>Leader or group member must hold at least one open class for this dance</p></li>
						<li><p>Dance must be performed at KPDC Showcase, December 1st, 2017 at 8:00pm.</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Breaking any of these rules will result in banning all group members from reserving dances for following semesters. While we encourage projects, we place higher priority on our subunits, thus we will be enforcing these rules.</p>
					<h3>Process</h3>
					<p>A form to sign up was posted on July 19, 2017 at 10:00pm. First come first serve. The results will be made public but will not be confirmed until after the form deadline.</p>
				</section>

					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					<h3>Why exactly are you doing this?</h3>
					<p>Subunits are great because they allow you to mingle, grow, and dance with other dancers in a consistent time and place. Everyone is guaranteed a subunit spot as well as a guaranteed chance to perform in the KPDC showcase--but not guaranteed to perform a specific dance. Subunits are formed for the purpose of <strong>giving everyone an opportunity to dance.</strong> However, projects allow members who feel stifled by the subunit process to perform their desired dance, but are not guaranteed full club support. <strong>If you are not completely confident about reserving a project, DO NOT reserve one.</strong></p>
					<h3>What if I don&#39;t have group members for my project?</h3>
					<p>You have the choice of either handpicking your members or submitting the reservation form with the purpose of looking for members to join you. The results will be public so people can contact you. If, however, by the form deadline you have not confirmed your group, the project will be dropped.</p>
					<h3>Can I still sign up for subunits/other projects?</h3>
					<p>Yes! You are only restricted to one <strong>reserved group</strong> project. You are still free to try for subunits and form other projects after the reservation time frame is over.</p>
					<h3>What if an emergency occurs and I end up breaking the rules?</h3>
					<p>We will make exceptions for extreme cases. Contact our secretary if this happens.</p>
